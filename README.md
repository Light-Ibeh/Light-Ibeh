✨ Light Ibeh — Cloud Engineer | Occupational Therapist | Creator

  

I’m Light — a Cloud Engineer, Occupational Therapist, and Content Creator passionate about building systems that reduce burnout, automate workflows, and improve access to care.

I just completed my Diploma in Cloud Engineering at AltSchool Africa, where I built real-world projects across Linux, Networking, AWS, CI/CD, Infrastructure, automation, and server deployment.
I combine my therapeutic background with engineering to design human-centered digital tools for therapists, caregivers, and the neurodivergent community.

I also create content on tech, digital income, and therapeutic awareness.
