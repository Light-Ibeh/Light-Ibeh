## 🌿 Hi, I'm Light

I’m a **Cloud Engineer**, **Occupational Therapist**, and **Digital Creator** building tools, content, and systems that make life easier for therapists, the neurodivergent community, and people living with chronic conditions like RA.

I recently completed my **Diploma in Cloud Engineering** at AltSchool Africa, where I built real-world projects around:

- Linux administration  
- Nginx & server deployments  
- AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, Route 53)  
- DNS, load balancing & networking  
- GitHub Actions & CI/CD  
- Infrastructure documentation

I blend **therapy + engineering** to create human-centered solutions — from automated assessment tools to burnout-prevention systems.
